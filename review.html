            <h1>Review of the Eflite Carbon Z Cub: 2 years later.</h1>
            <p>This is a review on the Carbon Z Cub after flying the plane. Now I know y'all are probably thing that the plane has been out for a while why write this review now. Well it is simple after having the plane for about 2 years now I can really
                do a good review now because I can see how it lasted over the years.</p>
            <h1>How is the paint?</h1>
            <p>After 2 years of flying this plane the paint on it is fine. However around the battery hatch the paint is starting to peel, but I don't really worry about that anymore because I use the Morgan Mill battery tray which works great by the way.</p>
            <h1>What about the electronics?</h1>
            <p>Almost all of the electronics in the plane are fine. The motor has been taken out of it because it's magnets starting to fall out but I put a eflite power 60 470kv motor in it about 2016. The esc I had burnt up because of where it is placed
                and had it's wires rubbing the motor and stripped the rubber and shorting out the esc so make sure the wires are not rubbing the motor. All but one servo has had to be replaced (It was my fault).</p>
            <h1>Structure now?</h1>
            <p>The structure is actually still going I had a few problems. I had crashed it nose down into the ground but just put some epoxy and carbon fiber rods in the nose and never had any problems (it was just a temporary solution till I replaced the
                fuse). The wing struts are not that great had a few that broke on me but put some carbon fiber rods in the indention and made them stronger. The only problem is the tail wheel it is not really strong and to change my rudder to fix it but
                now I just put some carbon fiber rods in the rudder and it works.</p>
            <h1>Upgrades</h1>
            <p>Well, since I had this plane for so long I did upgrade a few thing. First thing the Morgan Mill battery tray it makes life a whole lot easy putting those batteries in and out. Second thing was the wheels I put Kavan inflatable tires 6in and
                it works great and they are lighter than the stock ones. Third thing was a efuel gauge (only for futaba) which tells the milliamps of the battery and is almost accurate off by about 50 milliamps.</p>
            <h1>Conculsion</h1>
            <p>This is a really great plane. Been flying it for about 2 years now survived a many crashes and still going strong. Eflite really made a durable and relaible plane and hoping it could last another 2 years.</p>
